# Weather Dashboard API Project

## User Story 
```md
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Description

This project tested my knowledge of third-party and server-side APIs, JavaScript, jQuery.  I ensured that the code was debugged to the best of my ability and ran correctly.  This assignment was challenging but the implementation of server-side APIs has helped to further understand JS concepts. When I got stuck I used Google to research local storage and read through StackOverflow, and watched YouTube videos, as well as researching specific elements in W3Schools and MDN.
